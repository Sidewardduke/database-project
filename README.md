# database-project

This is a basic database project for my CS3380 class. This utilizes a node.js server to host a website that is a clone of Rate My Professor. The node.js server connects and interfaces with an SQL server to retrieve login data, professor information, comments, and other necessary data for the site to function.

# Install

```bash
git clone
```

# Run

```bash
start run.cmd
```
